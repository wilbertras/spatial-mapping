function [fm,SRRraw,SPPraw,SPRraw,nrrejected,sigmaxR5,sigmaxP5] = binfilefunction3(filename,meastime,freq)
% simplified from 2 by Jochem Aug 2019
% this is done in a separate function since it has to be done twice (50kHz and 1MHz sampled bin-files) for every noise spectrum
% 
% vs2 is with subtraction of calibration file (in FFT)
% 
% opens a binary file made by labview and reads 64 bit floating point data.
% labview 'header': First 4 bytes: rows in uint, second 4 bytes: columns in uint. 
% Than data row by row in BIG ENDIAN
% PWELCH = PSD * 2/samplefreq!!!
% 
% Variable names for the spectra:
% SRR: PSD of Radius
% SPP: PSD of Phase
% SPR: cross-PSD of R and P
% 
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%INPUT of binfilefucntion2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %%%%%%%%first four variables are different for med/fast bin-file, TDoption has the common options
% filename: name of the on-resonance bin-file to be processed
% meastime: time data is taken (if cal is used they have to be equal size).
% is the last item in xxdBm__all_td_averaged.dat file
% freq: sampling frequency of data-acquisition
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%OUTPUT of binfilefunction2%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% fm: frequency of the following PSDs (x-axis) 
% SRRraw: radius PSD of the on-resonance file 
% SPPraw: phase PSD of the on-resonance file
% SPRraw: cross PSD of the on-resonance file; NOTE: phase and radius PSD come out in log-space, cross-PSD comes out in linear space and it can be a complex number
% nrrejected: number of rejected time-domain pieces due to peaks
% sigmax5: the actual radius-level corresponding to the rejection threshold
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% This TDoption struct is convenient to transport the options through the functions
% define acquisition frequency and size of the files for both bin-files
% TDoption.freqmed = 50e3;              % standard is 50e3;
% TDoption.rowsmed = 2e6;               % standard is 2e6; (ie sampling for 40 s at 50 kHz)
% TDoption.freqfast = 1e6;              % standard is 1e6;
% TDoption.rowsfast = 2e5;              % standard is 2e5; (ie sampling for 200 ms at 1 MHz)

TDoption.nrsigma = 6;                 % peaks>TDoption.nrsigma*sigma are rejected (based on filtered TD-stream) %6 seems to be really minimum, 8 good value also for smaller peaks
TDoption.smoothtime = 3e-3;           % quasiparticle lifetime guess used for fit (note it will be updated if there is a resultfile present)
TDoption.average = 32;                % Nr of TDoption.averages for PSD, should be a multiple of 2 and nrpoints/TDoption.average should be integer. 
                                      % Average is also the number of pieces over which peak rejection is done, ie if TDoption.average=32 and a peak is found, 
                                      % that 1/32th piece is thrown away
TDoption.ppd = 30;                    % points per decade in frequency for logsmooth after calculating PSD, 
                                      % 30 (20) will give spectrum of 158 (105) points. 0 will give you the full spectrum, usually a million points
                                      % 30 is used standard in the SRON labview    
                                      % NOTE: if you want to use fitranges from earlier processing, make sure ppd is the same!!!
TDoption.savex = 0;                   % save filtered time domain data in csv-file (note some 90 Mb per file); Saves in data direcotory
TDoption.corroff = 1;                 % 1 = correct each piece of length/average with linear offset (to correct for very slow drifts, only relevant for 50 kHz files
