Measurement of the f-scatter due to setup effects

Measurement:
- 1st cooldown, did VNA calibration at 500 mK. Made VNA scan in Labview at 100mK from 5.5-6.5, 6.5-7.5 and 7.5-8GHz with 50 MHz scans, 6401 points, 1000 Hz IFbw, P=-112dBm. I had to do in in part because it could'nt do it in one go, for an unkown reason. I have converted this data to a single numpy array. 
Warmed up to T1=250K, T2=192K, T5=175K
- 2nd cooldown, used same VNA calibartion as before. Made VNA scan in Python in a single scan with same settings. There is a small offset in power between the scan of the Labview and Python scripts. This shouldn't matter for the f-scatter.
Warmed up to T1=93,4K, T2=24,5K, T5=21,8K
- 3rd cooldown, used same VNA calibartion as before. Made VNA scan with in Python same settings.
Warmed up to T1=99.1K, T2=31.5K, T5=29.7K, T6=26.4K. 
- 4th cooldown, used same VNA calibartion as before. Made VNA scan in Python with same settings. All f0s seem to have shifted to lower frequencies now.
